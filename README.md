# BMW-DDE4-EDC15c4-EcuID
A simple python program that can read the Software number of Bosch EDC15C4 ECU for both BMW and Land rover

Ori files for testing the ID function is in the designated folder.

Contribute if you want, my wish is to create a universal tool that offers solutions like EGR, DPF as well as Immo and other DTC. 
For all and any ECU there is.
